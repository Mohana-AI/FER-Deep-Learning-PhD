# Emotion Recognition from Sequence of Facial Expression
The FER system has been developed using the CNN-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) approach, derived from a sequence of facial expressions. The proposed architecture is shown below, and the results are stored in the FER-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) file, also work has been published by a reputed journal, you can read [CNN-LSTM (Bi-LSTM)](https://github.com/Mohana-Murugan/FER-Deep-Learning-PhD/blob/main/CNN-LSTM.pdf)
